# bikesharing


## Project Overview

For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from our '201908-citibike-tripdata' file from an integer into a 'datetime' datatype. We then used the converted datatype to create a set of visualizations that will allow the reader to see:

  * See the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  * See the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
  * See the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

We then added these visualizations to the two visualizations we made prior to transforming our datatype data.
