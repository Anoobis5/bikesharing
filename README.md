## Project Overview

Based on our August 2019 ridesharing data, the CitiBike program in New York City is doing very well. This success indicates that there is potential to expand bike sharing programs to other metropolitan cities, such as Des Moines, Iowa. 

For our proposal, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from our '201908-citibike-tripdata' file from an integer into a 'datetime' datatype. We then used the converted datatype to create a set of visualizations that will allow the reader to see:

  * See the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  * See the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
  * See the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

We then added these visualizations to the two visualizations we made prior to transforming our datatype data.

## Results

Looking at the over 2 million users of the Citibike program, about 65% of the users are men, and  81% of the users are subscribers to the program as opposed to casual customers.

According to the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219) the gender ratios in NYC are similar to those in Des Moines Iowa. In July of 2019, Des Moines was comprised of roughly 50.7% female, where NYC was 52.3% female. This could indicate that there could be similar trends based on gender demographics alone. In New York City, the highest density of Top Starting and Top Ending locations for Citibike trips occur most frequently in mid-town Manhattan. The highest density trips also correlate to popular tourist locations; as well as popular hotel locations.

When we look at the length of time for each bike rental, along with the number of rentals, we see that the majority of rentals are less than 30 minutes. This lets us know that it would be beneficial for the bikesharing service to cover the release demands of the potential users. Looking at the gender graph, the trend correlates to the amount of users, as there tend to be more male users. Male users also take slightly longer trips.
